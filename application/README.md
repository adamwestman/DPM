# DPM

Here lies the Application source used to build DPM.

## Compilation
 To compile an executable from source simply call the build.sh script:
```sh
$ ./build.sh
```
This will invoke the Makefile inside vendor/srlua and compile source starting with the src/main.lua, with the compiled executable output in build/dpm.o
